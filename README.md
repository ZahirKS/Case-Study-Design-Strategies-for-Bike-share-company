# Case Study: Design Strategies for Bike-share company to navigate speedy success


## Introduction
In which I analyze and design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members using real-world data provided by a bike-sharing company in Chicago.

* The final Cyclistic data analysis presentation is available at Google Slides.
* Documentation of Data Cleaning & Manipulation Using SQL.
* Documentation of Analyzing Data to Answer Questions Using SQL.
* Further analysis was done in Tableau Public and can be viewed at Cyclistic Data Analysis Tableau project.
### Recommendations
* Create customized annual packages with special offers for casual riders especially weekend users.
* Create a new type of bike that is fitting for longer trips, unlike docked bikes which for the past 12 months, only used by casual riders for longer duration trips. This can persuade casual users to sign up for a membership if they enjoy the new bike type or its design / features.
* Explore alternative memberships with (i). longer ride time limit or (b).weekend memberships.
* As a realistic approach to Chicago's weather & Winter service usage, Cyclistic should try a 8 month membership (March to October).
* Design a 3 month membership or summer membership for casual users to test the service; and give them the option to convert it into an annual or 8 month membership at the end of the membership period.
* Advertisements should be prevalent in the months before trips will start to increase or peak (months before Summer), March & April would be an ideal month.
* Focus advertisements on stations where casual riders tend to meet.
* Conduct surveys to collect demographics data for us to understand better casual riders.
